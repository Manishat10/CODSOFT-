            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vivekananda was born as Narendranath Datta (name shortened to Narendra or
                Naren) in a
                Bengali
                family in his
                ancestral home at 3 Gourmohan Mukherjee Street in Calcutta, the capital of British India, on 12 January
                1863 during
                the Makar Sankranti festival. He belonged to a traditional family and was one of nine siblings. His
                father,
                Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney at the Calcutta High Court. Durgacharan Datta, Narendra's
                grandfather was a
                Sanskrit and Persian scholar who left his family and became a monk at age twenty-five. His mother,
                Bhubaneswari
                Devi, was a devout housewife. The progressive, rational attitude of Narendra's father and the religious
                temperament
                of his mother helped shape his thinking and personality.Narendranath was interested in spirituality
                from a
                young age and used to meditate before the images of deities such as Shiva, Rama, Sita, and Mahavir
                Hanuman. He was
                fascinated by wandering ascetics and monks. Narendra was mischievous and restless as a child, and his
                parents often
                had difficulty controlling him. His mother said, "I prayed to Shiva for a son and he has sent me one of
                his
                demons".</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During his formative years, Narendranath (Vivekananda) exhibited
                exceptional intellect and diverse
                interests. Enrolled
                at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan Institution at the age of eight, he later attended the
                General Assembly's
                Institution (now known as the Scottish Church College), where he delved into a wide array of subjects,
                including
                philosophy, religion, history, social science, art, and literature.

                His academic prowess was evident when he scored the sole first-division marks in the Presidency College
                entrance exam
                upon his family's return to Calcutta in 1879. Narendranath was a voracious reader, deeply engaging with
                Hindu scriptures
                like the Vedas, Upanishads, and Bhagavad Gita, as well as Western philosophers such as Hume, Kant,
                Hegel, and Darwin.

                Narendranath's memory and speed reading abilities were extraordinary. He could quote pages from books
                like Pickwick
                Papers verbatim and recall historical details in debates, surprising even experts. At times, he left
                professors
                astounded by reciting and interpreting complex verses from texts he had just read. His prodigious memory
                led some to
                describe him as a "shrutidhara," a person with remarkable memorization skills.

                In 1884, he completed his Bachelor of Arts degree and drew praise from figures like William Hastie, the
                principal of
                Christian College, Calcutta, who predicted Narendranath's remarkable future achievements. His academic
                pursuits,
                wide-ranging interests, and extraordinary memory paved the way for his profound impact on philosophy and
                spirituality.<br></p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swami Vivekananda's legacy is remembered and celebrated through various
                avenues. His birthday, the 12th
                of January, is
                observed as National Youth Day in India, focusing on empowering the younger generation with his ideals.
                Additionally,
                the 11th of September, the date of his iconic speech at the Parliament of Religions, is recognized as
                "World Brotherhood
                Day," emphasizing the universal values of unity and harmony. The global celebrations of his 150th birth
                anniversary in
                2013 further highlight his enduring impact on individuals and communities, both within India and around
                the world.</p>
